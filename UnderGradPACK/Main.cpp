	Project Description :
	Undergraduate linear algebra pack or UDPACK is a tool made to assist in early linear algebra calculations expected in the undergraduate cirriculum
	The project is scalable and will eventually be open to other for contribution
	Starting Date 1/14/22

	Current goals include:
	-Matrix addition
	-Matrix subtraction
	-Matrix multiplication
	-Scalar addition
	-Scalar multiplication
	- Scalar Subraction
	-Scalar division
	-SVD decompositionn
	-QR factorization
	-Hessenberg form calcualtions
	-Househoulder reflections QR
	-QR method for eigenpairs
	-Lanczos method
	-Arnoldi method
	-Inverse

	-power iteration
	-numerical deflation
	-LU linear solver
	-Characteristic polynomial generator
	-Linear interpolation from solved systems
	-Eigencomputations
	-Complex eigenvalue computations
	-Determinant calculuations through cofactor expansion
	-Determinant calculuations through other means
	-LaTeX matrix generation exporting
	-Transpose
	-Matrix classification tools

	Constraints:
	-No tensor calculations
	-Matrices will start out at max of 20x20 and should have scalable output
